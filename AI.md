# AI Context for This Project

```text
Here are some important information about me:
- I am a student at Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering, Mechanical Design and Production Department.
- I have experience in different fields rather than mechanical engineering such as:
    - Web Development
    - MEP drafting

Here are some aspects of my personality:
- I have a lot of curiosity and love to search and learn new things even if they are not directly related to my field.
- I love to take things from the basic fundamentals and build on them.
- I am very enthusiastic about manufacturing and mechanical design and I love collecting skills and knowledge in this field.
- I love systematic and organized work but also love to be creative and think outside the box.
- I give a lot of care for Problem Solving and developed my own problem solving methodology and techniques.

I am a mechanical engineer who have a passion in 
- Mechanical Design
- Manufacturing
- CAD/CAE and Simulation
- Optimization
- Conceptual Design
- Mathematics
- Programming
- Science and Scientific Research

## Generating content 

I want the brief article to include the following:

- Physical description of the project including some number like capacity, weight, dimensions, etc.
- What is achieved in this project.
- Methods used in the project.
- What I did in the project.
- What I learned from the project.
- Further steps or future work.

You are a professional technical writer. I will provide you with detailed information about one of my projects. Based on the information I give you, generate a concise and well-structured article that includes the following sections if applicable:

1. Project Overview – Provide a clear physical description of the project, including quantitative details such as dimensions, weight, capacity, or other relevant specifications.
2. Project Objectives & Outcomes – Summarize what the project aimed to achieve and what was accomplished.
3. Methods & Techniques Used – Explain the main technical methods, tools, or processes used in the execution of the project.
4. My Role & Contributions – Describe what I specifically did in the project, including any problem-solving, design, or leadership contributions.
5. Key Learnings – Highlight the main skills or knowledge I gained from working on the project.
6. Future Work or Next Steps – Suggest logical extensions, improvements, or planned future developments related to this project.

Don't add key information that I don't mention in the project descriptions I will provide, don't assume anything that I didn't mention.  Don't use bullet lists so much, but use them when they are needed and when there are items to be listed

Project 1:

Three-Wheel Fire Truck

- Imporant quantities: 
    - Material  AISI 1010
    - Length  2000 mm 
    - Width  1100 mm 
    - Weight of Body and chassis  1200 kg 
    - Driver weight  100 kg  
    - Number of drivers  1 
    - Tank capacity  700 L 
- We decided to design a three-wheel fire truck prototype, we aimed to achieve profitable price and a real effective solution, we did
  - Chassis design (monocoque design)
  - Transmission system
  - Tank selection
  - Vehicle dynamics analysis and parameters selection
- I used these tools
    - SolidWorks for modeling and assembly.
    - Python for solving deflection equations.
- I was responsible for the vehicle dynamics analysis, I did full research to make the best decisions, I also was responsible for the deflection analysis, I used Python to solve complex system of equations.
- I learned a lot about vehicle dynamics, how to use Python for engineering calculations, and the fundamentals of parametrs selection for automotive design.

Skills

```
Mathematical Modeling: I always use Mathematical modeling to solve engineering problems, I also consider doing that before turing to code to implement these models and get results

Research and Development: I do a lot of research to find solutions, learn about the latest technologies and methods, and choose best solution from available options. I also do development of ideas to customize solutions solutions, combine them, or create totally new solutions.

Problem Solving: in the past years I developed a framework for me to solve problems in the most efficient, effective, consistent, and sustainable way I can. From time to time I add new techniques, methods, and tools to this framework to make it more powerful and useful.

Programming: I learned programming from a young age and I practice programming in many applications like engineering calculations and plotting, automation, web scraping, simple data analysis, and web development. I use Python and JavaScript as my main programming languages

Manufacturing: I gained good amount of knowledge about manufacturing processes and manufacturing systems. I consider manufacturing to be my passion and I love to learn more about it. 

Mechanical Design: I gained a lot of experience in mechanical design through my projects and the workshop that I did. I went deeper with more advanced topics of mechanical design like DFX (like DFM, DFA, etc.), conceptual design, optimization of mechanical systems, and more. I combine all the tools in my toolbox to work on mechanical design problems.

Academic Writing: I use LaTeX to write all the importand documents, however, LaTeX is just a tool not a skill in itself. I love to write in a clear, concise, organized, and professional way and replicated the writing styles of research papers and textbooks in the documents I write.
