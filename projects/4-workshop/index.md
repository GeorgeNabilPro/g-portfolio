### 1. Project Overview

As the head of the mechanical design committee within [Pascal Academy](https://www.facebook.com/PascalCUFE), I led a team of 10 members in the creation and delivery of a comprehensive workshop on Mechanical Design. The workshop consisted of **six sessions** covering a wide range of topics essential for aspiring mechanical engineers.

### 2. Project Objectives & Outcomes

The primary objective was to provide students with a solid foundation in Mechanical Design principles and practical skills. The workshop successfully reached over **50 students in person** and **more than 300 online**, effectively simplifying complex engineering concepts and fostering a deeper practical understanding.

### 3. Methods & Techniques Used

The workshop sessions covered topics including:

* Fundamentals of Mechanical Design
* Conceptual Design
* Freehand Sketching
* Introduction to FEA
* DFMA (Design for Manufacturing and Assembly)
* How to Work on Mechanical Design Projects
* Different Machine Parts
* Different Design Features (like shaft features, DFM features, etc.)
* Important concepts (stress concentration, fatigue, prototyping, etc.)

To enhance learning, physical models and real machine parts were used as demonstration tools.

### 4. My Role & Contributions

I spearheaded this initiative by leading the mechanical design committee. My responsibilities included:

* Team management.
* Planning the workshop curriculum and schedule.
* Task delegation.
* Serving as the primary tutor.
* Developing the content for the six sessions.
* Delivering instruction to both in-person and online attendees.
* Facilitating collaboration with other teams within Pascal (HR, High Board, Media).

### 5. Key Learnings

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

* Long-term planning.
* Tutoring and explaining complex technical subjects.
* Enhanced knowledge in mechanical design and related concepts and tools.
* Team management and inter-team collaboration.
* Creating high-quality instructional content in slide format.

### 6. Future Work or Next Steps

Future plans for this workshop include:

* Enhancing the existing content further.
* Developing supplementary video materials for offline sessions.
* Incorporating a wider array of physical models for demonstrations.
