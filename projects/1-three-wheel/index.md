## Project Overview

The project involved the design of a three-wheel fire truck prototype. The physical specifications of the prototype include a length of 2000 mm and a width of 1100 mm. The body and chassis are constructed from AISI 1010 steel and have a combined weight of 1200 kg. The vehicle is designed to accommodate one driver (weighing 100 kg) and features a water tank with a capacity of 700 L.

### Project Objectives & Outcomes

The primary objectives of this project were to design a three-wheel fire truck prototype that offered a profitable price point and an effective firefighting solution. The team successfully completed the following: chassis design (utilizing a monocoque structure), transmission system design, tank selection, and vehicle dynamics analysis along with parameter selection.

### Methods & Techniques Used

The project employed several key tools and techniques. SolidWorks was utilized for the 3D modeling and assembly of the fire truck. Python was used for solving deflection equations encountered during the analysis phase.

## My Role & Contributions

As a member of a six-person team, my responsibilities focused on the vehicle dynamics analysis. This involved comprehensive research to inform optimal design decisions. Additionally, I was responsible for the deflection analysis, where I utilized Python to solve a complex system of equations.

## Key Learnings

Through my involvement in this project, I gained significant knowledge in the field of vehicle dynamics and the fundamentals of parameter selection for automotive design. Furthermore, I developed practical skills in using Python for complex engineering calculations.
