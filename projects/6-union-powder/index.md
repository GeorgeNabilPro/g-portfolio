This is an industrial engineering project undertaken during my internship at Union Powder Coatings, focusing on the redesign of the Masterbatch production facility. The project aimed to enhance operational efficiency by optimizing the physical layout and material flow within the Plastic Pellet Production area.

## Project Overview

The core of this project involved the comprehensive redesign of the existing **Masterbatch production facility**, specifically the area dedicated to Plastic Pellet Production. While detailed quantitative specifications such as overall facility dimensions or total production capacity were part of the data collection phase, the primary focus here is on the layout and process flow. At the culmination of the internship, I was entrusted with responsibility for this production facility, driving the initiative to conceptualize a new, optimized layout.

### Project Objectives & Outcomes

The principal objective was to **design a new facility layout** intended to replace the current one. This new design aimed to significantly **reduce waste** and **optimize the movement of both materials and labor** compared to the old facility. The primary outcome of this project was a **comprehensive proposed new layout**, visualized through 3D modeling, which demonstrated an improved workflow and addressed inefficiencies identified in the existing setup.


### Methods & Techniques Used

To achieve the project's objectives, several industrial engineering methods and tools were employed. The process began with **data collection and in-depth analysis** of the existing Plastic Pellet Production Facility layout, which involved gathering precise dimensions, understanding process details, and acquiring operational insights.

**Spaghetti diagrams and process flow charts** were developed using **Microsoft Visio** to visually map current material and personnel movements. This visualization was crucial for identifying bottlenecks and areas where motion efficiency could be significantly improved. **Motion studies**, incorporating **ergonomic principles**, were conducted to analyze worker tasks and material handling. This analysis aimed to optimize workstation design, thereby enhancing worker comfort and productivity.

Finally, the proposed new layout was designed and visualized using **SOLIDWORKS**. This involved creating detailed 3D models of the Plastic Pellet Production Facility and its production lines to effectively demonstrate the optimized workflow and spatial arrangements.

## My Role & Contributions

In this project, I was responsible for spearheading several key activities. My contributions included:

* Leading the **data collection and analysis** of the existing facility.
* Developing **spaghetti diagrams and process flow charts** to map and analyze process flows, pinpointing inefficiencies.
* Conducting **motion studies** with a focus on ergonomic improvements for workers and material movement.
* **Designing and visualizing the proposed new layout** in 3D, creating comprehensive models to illustrate the optimized workflow.
* Concentrating efforts on **optimizing motion flow, facility utilities, and the overall design** of the proposed layout to enhance workflow, reduce travel distances, and improve overall operational efficiency.

A significant part of my contribution involved developing innovative solutions to existing problems. These included:
* A **new discharging system** to improve material handling.
* A **new system to organize the motion of Material Buckets**, streamlining their movement throughout the facility.
* A **system to reduce contamination**, a critical issue often arising during the mixing and material handling processes.

### Key Learnings

This project was instrumental in strengthening my practical skills in core industrial engineering methodologies. I gained hands-on experience in **facility planning, 5S principles, ergonomics, motion study, process modeling, and layout design**. Beyond these technical competencies, the project significantly enhanced my **problem-solving and analytical abilities**. Working in a real-world manufacturing environment also helped develop my **communication and teamwork skills**.

## Next Steps

While this internship project concluded with the proposed design, there are logical extensions for future development. Ideally, the next steps would involve:

* **Simulating the entire facility using software like AnyLogic** to validate the proposed design's performance metrics and identify any further optimization opportunities before implementation.
* Developing **more comprehensive solutions to further optimize production**, potentially by researching and integrating the most modern and advanced manufacturing technologies and systems available in the market.
