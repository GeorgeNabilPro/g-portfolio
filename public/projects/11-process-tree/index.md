This is a personal web-based project dedicated to the collection, organization, and presentation of a wide array of manufacturing processes. The initiative aimed to create a valuable educational resource while deepening personal understanding of the manufacturing landscape.


## Project Overview

**Process Tree** is a personally developed website designed to serve as an extensive knowledge base for manufacturing processes. The platform currently hosts detailed information on **more than 250 distinct manufacturing processes**, meticulously collected and organized for ease of access and understanding. This project represents a significant individual effort in curating and structuring complex technical information into a user-friendly online format.


### Project Objectives & Outcomes

The primary objective of the Process Tree project was to **compile and systematically organize a comprehensive collection of manufacturing processes** from diverse sources. This endeavor aimed to create a go-to digital resource for anyone interested in learning about how products are made. A secondary, yet equally important, objective was to personally gain **in-depth knowledge of manufacturing systems, specific processes, process selection criteria, and foundational manufacturing principles.**

The main outcome of this project is the **successful launch and population of the Process Tree website**, which now serves as a rich repository of information on over 250 manufacturing techniques.


### Methods & Techniques Used

The development of Process Tree involved two main streams of effort: extensive research and content creation, followed by website development using modern web technologies.

**Research and Content Curation:**
The foundation of Process Tree was built upon thorough research. This involved:
* Conducting numerous **online searches** to gather information on various manufacturing processes.
* Consulting a wide range of **authoritative textbooks** on manufacturing and specific process technologies. The reference materials included:
    * Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing 4th edition - Mikell P. Groover
    * Welding Engineering An Introduction 1st edition - David H. Phillips
    * Fritz Klocke - Manufacturing Processes 1 - Cutting
    * Machining Technology - Helmi A. Youssef, Hassan El-Hofy
    * Complete Casting Handbook - John Compbell
    * Injection Mold Design Engineering 2nd edition - Dvaid O. Kazmer
    * Handbook of Surface and Nanometrology - David J. Whitehouse
    * Plastics Processing Data Handbook - Donald V. Rosato, Dominick V. Rosato
    * Welding and Metal Fabrication - Larry Jeffus
    * Fritz Klocke - Manufacturing Processes 2 - Grinding, Honing, Lapping
    * Principles of Abrasive Processing - Shaw, Milton C.
    * DeGarmo's Materials and Processes in Manufacturing - J T. Black, Ronald A. Kohser
    * Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide - Robert H. Todd, Dell K. Allen, Leo Alting
    * Machinery's Handbook - Erik Oberg, Frandklin D. Jones, Holbrook L. Horton, Henry H. Ryffel
    * Fritz Klocke - Manufacturing Processes 4 - Forming
    * Sheet Metal Forming Fundamentals - Taylan Altan, A. Erman Tekkaya
    * Schuler - Metal Forming Handbook
    * Principles of metal manufacturing processes - 1999 - J. Beddoes, M. Bibby
    * Serope Kalpakjian, Steven Schmid - Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials (2016, Pearson) - libgen.li
    * Advanced Machining and Manufacturing Processes - Kaushik Kumar, Divya Zindani
    * Mechanical Engineers Reference Book 12th edition - Edward H. Smith

**Web Development:**
To bring Process Tree to life as an accessible online platform, a modern technology stack was employed:
* **Frontend Frameworks:** React and Next.js were utilized to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and ShadCN were implemented for efficient and contemporary styling of the website.
* **Programming Language:** TypeScript was used to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.


### My Role & Contributions

As a personal project, I was solely responsible for all aspects of Process Tree's creation. My contributions encompassed:
* **Conceptualization and planning** of the website's structure and content strategy.
* **Extensive research** to identify, understand, and gather data on over 250 manufacturing processes from diverse online and academic sources, including the textbooks listed above.
* **Content creation and organization**, transforming raw data into structured, understandable information.
* **Full-stack web development**, including designing the user interface, developing the frontend and backend functionalities, and deploying the website. This involved utilizing the aforementioned tech stack (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, TypeScript).


### Key Learnings

This project was a significant learning experience, yielding substantial knowledge in both manufacturing and web development domains.
* **Manufacturing Expertise:** I developed a comprehensive understanding of various **manufacturing systems, a multitude of specific manufacturing processes, the critical factors involved in process selection, and the foundational principles that guide the manufacturing industry.** This was significantly aided by the in-depth study of the aforementioned academic resources.
* **Technical Skills:** I gained hands-on proficiency in utilizing top-tier web development frameworks and tools, including **React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, and TypeScript**, building a complex application from the ground up.


## Future Work or Next Steps

Process Tree is an ongoing endeavor with several exciting plans for future development:
* **Integration with "Mecha Puzzle":** There is a plan to merge Process Tree into a larger, forthcoming personal project named "Mecha Puzzle," aiming to create a more comprehensive and interconnected platform.
* **Content Expansion:** Continuous efforts will be made to **add more detailed information and richer content** to the existing manufacturing processes, as well as introduce new processes to the database.
* **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:** Future updates will focus on **improving the overall user experience** by incorporating new UX features and refining the existing interface for better navigation and engagement.

These future steps aim to further enhance the value of Process Tree as a leading resource for manufacturing process information.
