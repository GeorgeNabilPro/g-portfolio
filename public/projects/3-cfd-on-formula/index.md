## Project Overview

This was a self-directed project focused on utilizing Ansys Fluent to practice CFD simulation techniques and develop familiarity with the software's capabilities.

## Project Objectives & Outcomes

The primary objective was to gain hands-on experience with Ansys Fluent and to understand the fundamental processes involved in CFD simulation. Through this project, I successfully learned about various aspects of the simulation workflow within Ansys Fluent. Through this project, I learned about:

* Mesh types and mesh quality considerations.
* Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and CFD simulation.
* Different types of result plots, such as contours and streamlines.
* How to input parameters and effectively use various modules within Ansys Fluent.

## Future Work or Next Steps

Potential future steps could involve tackling more complex CFD problems, experimenting with different physical models and solver settings in Ansys Fluent, and further refining my skills in mesh generation and results interpretation.
