In this short article, I summarize four years of hands-on experience in executing a variety of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) projects. Undertaken as a side job alongside my mechanical engineering studies, these projects provided invaluable practical exposure and a deep understanding of the project lifecycle, from client consultation to on-site installation. Working in collaboration with my father, I helped deliver cost-effective and robust engineering solutions for numerous clients.

## Overview

Over the past four years, I have been responsible for the MEP design of multiple small to medium-scale commercial facilities, including retail stores, offices, and inventories. My work encompassed the complete design and coordination of all essential building systems.

This involved using **AutoCAD** to produce a full suite of MEP drawings, including layouts for:

  * Fire Fighting and Fire Alarm systems
  * Plumbing and drainage
  * HVAC (Air Conditioning and Ventilation)
  * Electrical Lighting and Power Sockets
  * Light Current systems

A key part of the design process was ensuring seamless integration. I developed coordinated **Reflected Ceiling Plans (RCPs)** to resolve conflicts between various systems and architectural elements, ensuring a smooth installation phase. Furthermore, I was responsible for preparing crucial project documentation, including **Bills of Quantities (BOQs)**, **Technical Offers**, and **Financial Offers**.

### My Role & Contributions

My role in these projects was multifaceted, covering technical design, client management, and regulatory compliance. In some cases I worked directly with customers and shop owners.

A significant part of my responsibilities involved liaising with the technical offices of commercial malls and properties. This required submitting my MEP drawings for review, interpreting their comments and requirements, and making the necessary modifications to gain approval. This process honed my ability to defend design choices while adapting to specific building standards. I was also actively involved on-site during the installation phase, where I collaborated with technicians and other engineers, gaining practical experience in troubleshooting and managing the implementation of my designs.

## Key Learnings

This sustained engagement in real-world projects has been a cornerstone of my professional development, providing me with skills and knowledge that complement my academic education.

  * **Practical Problem Solving:** I gained extensive practice in identifying and resolving tangible MEP issues, from spatial conflicts between ductwork and piping to ensuring adequate power distribution for specialized equipment.
  * **Commercial Acumen:** I developed a strong understanding of the MEP market, including material and labor pricing.
  * **Technical Negotiation and Communication:** I learned how to effectively navigate the demanding technical review process. This involved articulating design rationales, negotiating practical solutions to feedback from technical offices, and maintaining clear, professional communication at all times.
  * **Code Compliance:** I became proficient in applying key industry standards, such as **NFPA 13** for fire suppression systems and **SMACNA** for HVAC ductwork.
  * **Time Management:** Balancing these professional commitments with the rigors of my Mechanical Engineering degree instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and advanced my time management skills, enabling me to meet competing deadlines without compromising on quality.
